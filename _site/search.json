    "text": "BASH Commands\nInstead of clicking on things to run them such as in a graphical user interface (GUI), command line requires, well, commands to do anything\n\n\n\nanatomy of a command\n\n\nUNIX comes with lots of commands (similar to functions in R or Python), but lets start out slow\n\nBaby’s first command: pwd\nLets start with an easy and useful command - pwd which prints the working directory\nType it into the terminal, press enter and see what happens\npwd\n/fs/ess/PAS1640\nEssentially what is happening is we give some input and the output is printed onto the screen which is the default for most UNIX commands\n\n\nCommand with arguments: cal\nHere is another easy example of a command in CLI - cal\ncal\n      June 2024     \nSu Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa\n                   1\n 2  3  4  5  6  7  8\n 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n16 17 18 19 20 21 22\n23 24 25 26 27 28 29\n30\nType in, press enter, get a calendar printed out\nBut we can modify what this command does with arguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\nArguments (also sometimes called flags) come after a command and are preceded by a dash (-) and most often are a single letter\n\n\n\nWith the -j argument using cal we can get printed the Julian calendar instead\ncal -j\n         June 2024         \nSun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat\n                        153\n154 155 156 157 158 159 160\n161 162 163 164 165 166 167\n168 169 170 171 172 173 174\n175 176 177 178 179 180 181\n182\n\n\nGetting help with -h\nMost commands have multiple arguments, some of which are required for the command to work. We can usually check what a command does and what its arguments are with the -h argument\nLet’s try it with cal\ncal -h\nUsage:\n cal [options] [[[day] month] year]\n\nOptions:\n -1, --one        show only current month (default)\n -3, --three      show previous, current and next month\n -s, --sunday     Sunday as first day of week\n -m, --monday     Monday as first day of week\n -j, --julian     output Julian dates\n -y, --year       show whole current year\n -V, --version    display version information and exit\n -h, --help       display this help text and exit\nFrom this we can see cal has a lot of different options. Just for funsies lets look at using the -3 which prints three monts AND the -j argument simultainiously\nhere, we put the arguments next to each other in any order\ncal -3 -j\n          May 2024                    June 2024                    July 2024         \nSun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat  Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat  Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat\n            122 123 124 125                          153      183 184 185 186 187 188\n126 127 128 129 130 131 132  154 155 156 157 158 159 160  189 190 191 192 193 194 195\n133 134 135 136 137 138 139  161 162 163 164 165 166 167  196 197 198 199 200 201 202\n140 141 142 143 144 145 146  168 169 170 171 172 173 174  203 204 205 206 207 208 209\n147 148 149 150 151 152      175 176 177 178 179 180 181  210 211 212 213            \n                             182  \nArguments can also be passed after the same dash\ncal -3j\n          May 2024                    June 2024                    July 2024         \nSun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat  Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat  Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat\n            122 123 124 125                          153      183 184 185 186 187 188\n126 127 128 129 130 131 132  154 155 156 157 158 159 160  189 190 191 192 193 194 195\n133 134 135 136 137 138 139  161 162 163 164 165 166 167  196 197 198 199 200 201 202\n140 141 142 143 144 145 146  168 169 170 171 172 173 174  203 204 205 206 207 208 209\n147 148 149 150 151 152      175 176 177 178 179 180 181  210 211 212 213            \n                             182  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpell it out\n\n\n\n\n\nArguments can (but not always) be written out following two preceding dashes (–)\ne.g., -h can be specified out with --help\ndepending on the command, it can require the spelled out or the shortened form, but most basic commands should have both available"

It is good to get into the habbit of using relative paths instead of absolute ones in case we move anything around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on movement\n\n\n\n\n\nevery dir has a few hidden directories that are useful to get around\n\n. : is the dir of your current dir\n.. : is the dir directly above you\n\nto go back a level, use cd ..\n\n\n\nif we want to go further into the dir, we can spell out the whole dir to get to the level_3 dir\ncd level_1/level_2/level_3/\nlets check\npwd\nand to get back out, we can use ..\ncd ../../../../\n\n\nMaking directories with mkdir\nmkdir takes a dir as an argument and creates it if one does not already exist\nfor practice, lets navigate to the users folder and make our own folder!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nGet to the \\users dir without me showing you!!\n\n\nSolution (click here)\n\nfrom within \\PAS1640\ncd \\users\n\n\n\n\nMaking your own dir\nWithin the \\users dir we can make our own directories!!\ncall it whatever you want, but I personally recommend using\nmkdir $USER\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tiny bit on variables\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I’m skipping a detailed explanation on variables, I’ll quickly mention them here\nin UNIX, variables are kept in objects beginning with a dollar sign ($)\nthere are a few default ones such as\n\n$HOME : stores the name of the home dir\n$USER : stores the name of the user\n\nto see what a variable contains, try the echo function\n# this is a general example, don't run it\necho$&lt;VARIABLE&gt;\necho$USER\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncp - copy paste\ncp takes two files as arguments, copying the first to the second\ne.g.,\n```bash cp"
